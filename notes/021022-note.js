Encapsulation - not effective outside of the class, not public exposed like ssn
Abstraction - model something, further refine/generalize the concept
Inheritance
Polymorphism 

A class is a blueprint
class defines the attributes and behaviors that all objects derived from the class will have
class must define the basic building blocks of the objects

instance is when you create something based on that class
  
constructor -> things you want to assign to your attributes within your class, for immutability if with no setter
  

include
require
include once  //only load once
require once  //only load once


static can only access to static, you have to create static function to access to the static
static is not instance variables, can not be changed through non-static
static belongs to the no instance of the class, shares along with the whole instance, not for instance variables


by default, interface is public
folder for interface, a folder for class


class Square implements Shape {}
class Triangle implements Shape {}


namespace


PDO vs MySQLi

MVC
model view controller
model - data/object
view - what the user sees, UI
controller - CRUD


PHP has abstract classes and methods. 
Classes defined as abstract cannot be instantiated, and any class that contains at least one abstract method must also be abstract.
